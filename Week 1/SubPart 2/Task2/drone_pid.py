Task 2 -

This problem aims to experimentally show you the importance of the Integral term for removing the steady state error.

A PID controller has been implemented to adjust the altitude of the drone.
You can adjust the PID gain throught the track-bars which will appear when you run the code.

Experiment with the PID gains and observe what effect they have on the drone's motion and can you relate them with what you have learnt so far.

Find the ideal PID gains such that the drone reaches the height of 3 meters without much fluctuation and as fast/stably as possible.

Observe why it is almost impossible to control the drone perfectly with using an additional integrating term.

The code is not necessary to go through, but understanding the code will benefit while doing the Task 3 and further weeks. That's why the code has been well-commented.

            Divinding factors are determined experimentally, we let track-bars have values from 0-500 
            and divide the value we get from them to get adjust them to the required range
            For example, if track-bar is at 100, but I should be around 0.01, so we divide by 10000 to get the final value in desired range.
            This is done as track-bars only support integer values
